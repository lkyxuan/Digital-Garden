# Welcome! 🌱

<p style="padding: 3em 1em; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
This is a private page for 0xmiracle's lifetime CRYPTO research work.
I previously tried various methods of sorting out what I had seen in the industry and eventually took notes using obsidian and the schedule using Notion. Given how often I need to bring him up to date now, he stays with me locally as a whole, and I don't mind using filecoin or Arweave to edit if technically feasible.

这是一个私人网页，用于0xmiracle的终生CRYPTO研究工作。
之前我尝试了多种梳理自己在行业中见闻的方法，最终采取笔记使用obsidian而日程使用Notion的形式。鉴于我现在经常需要将他更新，所以他整体保留在我本地，如果技术可行的话，我并不介意使用filecoin或是Arweave来编辑。
